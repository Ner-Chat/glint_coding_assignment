# Ner Chat Coding Assignment

Welcome to the Ner Chat coding assignment! This challenge is designed to evaluate your React debugging and styling skills.

**Expected time:** ~1 hour for experienced developers

**Tools:** Feel free to use any IDE of your choice. You're also welcome to use AI coding tools like Cursor or Claude Code — we encourage efficient development!

---

## Getting Started

npm run dev
```

This will start the dev server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## The Challenge

There are **4 tasks** to complete:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Fix the broken text input |
| 2 | Fix the focus issue |
| 3 | Add a delete confirmation dialog |
| 4 | Redesign the page with Tailwind |

### Task 1: Fix the broken text input

The first text input doesn't update when you type. Find and fix the bug.

### Task 2: Fix the focus issue

The second text input loses focus after every keystroke. Find and fix the bug.

### Task 3: Add a delete confirmation

When clicking the X button to delete a row, a confirmation dialog should appear asking "Are you sure you want to delete this row?" Feel free to create a custom component or use a library.

### Task 4: Make it look nice

The page is currently plain HTML. Use Tailwind CSS to redesign the entire page — we'd love to see your design skills! Some ideas to consider:

- Background colors or themes
- Proper visual hierarchy and spacing
- Modern, polished UI components
- Micro-interactions or animations

---

## What We're Looking For

- Clean, readable code
- Thoughtful UI/UX decisions
- Problem-solving approach

---

## Submission

When you're done, please submit your solution using one of these methods:

1. **Email a zip file** of your completed project (excluding `node_modules`)
2. **Create a private GitHub repository** and invite [@scottsoif](https://github.com/scottsoif) as a collaborator

Please ensure your submission includes all source files and any additional documentation you think would be helpful.

Good luck!
